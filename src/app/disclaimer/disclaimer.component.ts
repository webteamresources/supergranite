However if any mistakes have been made these are made inadvertently and in a bonafide way. So kindly inform us and we will correct it immediately.</p><p><b>2) Quality: </b><br>We attempt to supply and export the best quality products. However stone is a product of nature and no two pieces is exactly alike. So the variations that you see in color and texture is a natural phenomenon. In this regard we obtain approval of the samples from the customers before supplying. Even then variations are possible and acceptable and customers need to understand this.</p><p><b>3) Packaging: </b><br>All packing is done in strong and safe packages so that the products are delivered to customers in safe and intact way. Photos are sent to buyers before dispatch and their approval obtained. Despite taking all precautions there may be an isolated incident when breakage can occur due to the long transport journey and multiple handling of packages along the way. Super Granites and Marbles does not accept claims in this regard although we do support our customer with insurance coverage.</p><p><b>4) Delivery: </b><br>Normally the deliveries are on time. If in some rare case there is some natural calamity like floods, heavy rains, storm etc. or civil problem like strike, civic unrest, shit down of port etc. then there might be delay in delivery. Customers are advised of the situation immediately and Super Granites and Marbles does not entertain any claims arising out of such delays.</p><p><b>5) Availability of material: </b><br>Granites is a natural product and sometimes quarries get exhausted so some color may not be available. We keep our customers informed of the developing situations.</p>';
